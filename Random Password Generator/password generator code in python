Certainly!, Let's simplify the code by saying the following:

1. A program that creates strong, random passwords is what we want to build.  

2. String and random are two crucial Python tools that we employ in this process.

3. The code runs as follows, step by step:

4. To produce the passwords, we write a function named generate_password. We provide it with a number called length since it wants to know how long the password should be.

5. Inside the function generate_password:

6. We create a single lengthy list of characters by combining all the letters—both uppercase and lowercase—numbers, and special characters ($, *, @).

7. We repeat this process a certain number of times, choosing characters at random from this list.

8. To make the password, these various characters are combined at random.

this is how the random password generator works in my py program ,but others may use any other logic to do it 
which will be available in my repo in it ..........

HAPPY LEARNING!
